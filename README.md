# â˜• Dripper

**Dripper** is an architecture framework for SwiftUI project.\
It's a lightweight framework focusing on a very core concepts of [Swift-Composable-Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) from Point-Free.

These are the core concepts we needed:
1. Contravariance usage of micro-states/actions within its parent state/action.
2. Unidirectional mutation flow for concise state handling.
3. Simple to divide responsibility, simple to unit-test.
